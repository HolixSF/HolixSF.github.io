Hey everyone! Second post and I already find myself showing off what I learned! We are currently in week 3 of the program and this week we are learning all about CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used in creating the styling part of a website and goes hand in hand with HTML. This week was tough for me because I spent a lot of time on the styling of my webpage. I wanted it a certain way and could not stand it when it wasnt going the way I wanted. The best part is, once your done with CSS your webpage will look amazing and just the way you want it!

One of the biggest challenges in CSS is knowing the difference between the margin, border, and padding of an element. We can think of elements on our webpage to be like boxes. The properties of margin, border, and padding are boxes that go around the element. We can use the picture above to decribe this box model. Lets start with padding. Padding is the space between the elements content and its border. If you drew a box around your element, then the space between those boxes is your padding. Next up is our border. The border is what surrounds your elements content. The line that you drew around your element is considered the elements border. By this time you can pretty much guess where were going with this. The margin is the space between your elements border and the edge of your page. As you can see these properties are pretty important when styling a webpage. Knowing the size of your boxes and its position is critical in organizing your page the way you want it.
