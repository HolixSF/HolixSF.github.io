It's our last week on phase 0 and what a crazy time I have had. I definitely learned a lot during my time offsite from DBC. One of the things that I really struggled with was handling my website.

Creating my website was not an easy task. We started with basic HTML and creating a basic layout of our page. That was easy to understand and I was able to create a basic webpage. It all went downhill from there.. Once we got started with learning CSS my brain fried trying to understand and manipulate my webpage. There was just such a multitude of things going on and keeping up was really hard. The more pages we needed to create and link to each other the harder it became. I would change one thing to fix an element then next thing you know the whole page is wrong and skewed. I really struggled with making my website the way I wanted.

As we kept on learning new things, I stumbled upon the Jekyll framework in creating static webpages. I thought to myself 'wow this makes it look easy'. Man was I wrong.. Jekyll was a whole new beast on its own. It took me a long time grasping the basic knowledge needed to make it work. Jekyll is how I made the site your looking at now. I didn't create it from scratch of course, there are a lot of templates online that you can use and just modify yourself. I modified this template the way I wanted and added all the previous work I had created from before. It turned out pretty good I think.

I'm still a long way from mastering this but I think I'm on the right track. I want to definitely get a better understanding of how a website works because it frustrates me when I can't do it myself. There is a long road ahead and I'm ready.
