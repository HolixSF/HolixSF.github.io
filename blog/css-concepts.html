              <h3>What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?</h3>
              <h4>Saturday, November 7, 2015</h4>
                <p>Hey everyone! Second post and I already find myself showing off what I learned! We are currently in week 3 of the program and this week we are learning all about CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used in creating the styling part of a website and goes hand in hand with HTML. This week was tough for me because I spent a lot of time on the styling of my webpage. I wanted it a certain way and could not stand it when it wasnt going the way I wanted. The best part is, once your done with CSS your webpage will look amazing and just the way you want it!.</p>
                <p><img src="../imgs/boxmodel.png" alt="Box Model"></p>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges in CSS is knowing the difference between the margin, border, and padding of an element. We can think of elements on our webpage to be like boxes. The properties of margin, border, and padding are boxes that go around the element. We can consider all these as a box model. Lets start with padding. Padding is the space between the elements content and its border. If you drew a box around your element, then the space between those boxes is your padding. Next up is our border. The border is what surrounds your elements content. The line that you drew around your element is considered the elements border. By this time you can pretty much guess where were going with this. The margin is the space between your elements border and the edge of your page. As you can see these properties are pretty important when styling a webpage. Knowing the size of your boxes and its position is critial in organizing your page the way you want it.</p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	
	It was fun! We got to share our ideas with each other and made the wireframing process alot easier.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

	Yes. It definitely helps when trying to get your idea down and seeing how it looks on paper instead of in your head. It also helps bring more ideas into your head of how you want it to look.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

	We both agreed on simplicity. We wanted it to have all the basic stuff but also kept it simple.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

	We tried to use the section tag and actually had to look it up to see how to use it properly.
