              <h3>First week so far</h3>
                <h4>Friday, October 23, 2015</h4>
                <p>The first week of Devbootcamp is almost over! It feels like the week went by so fast! Its already friday and I have learned so much this week its crazy. So far we learned how to use the command line, whether it be using the terminal for mac users or the command prompt for windows and we also learned alot about version control using Git and GitHub. I actually had some experience learning some of the basic stuff beforehand but actually writing them and going through the process really helps to understand the concepts. With the command line, it will really help you to memorize the different commands and what they do. It also helps to use the terminal to do every single task without using your mouse so that you get used to it. Knowing how to navigate your terminal, create, modify and remove things are super mandatory for whats to come. Just knowing the commands and actually using my terminal, Im already starting to feel like a programmer!</p>
                <p>After the command line, we learned about version control. What is version control? Basically version control takes your project and creates versions or copies of it. Those copies can then be modified individually at the same time without affecting the original and then be merged back to the original. That means that if you are working in a group then everyone can work on the same project without affecting each others changes. This is awesome because its very fast and very efficient. You can also go back to different versions in case there are problems or bugs. It saves all the different points in your work so that you can go back to them if you want. Git is the program we learned to use for version control and its awesome. Github is the website where we send our projects to be compiled, changed, or pulled from by anyone.</p>
                <p>GitHub is like the all time mecca for code. Why use GitHub you ask? Its lightning quick and everyone uses it. Its like the dropbox for code! That means everyone can access everyone elses work, clone it, and work on it themselves. Its great for team projects or anything that requires multiple people to do. Its easy to use and easy to understand. I think learning Git is the hard part and learning how to use GitHub is easier. Once I get more used to using Git and GitHub I think that organizing and working on my projects will definitely be alot more fluid. I wanna learn more and start making some cool stuff. Im excited for the weeks to come!</p>
