What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

	I learned that everything is just a box within a box. Kinda like a box of inceptions haha. I learned that padding is the space between an element and its border. The border is the space between the padding and the margin, and the margin is the space between the border and the page!

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

	Positioning is very important as one little mistake on the size or position of an element can mess up the whole page.
	Fixed is useful to keep elements frozen even while scrolling. Relative moves the element relative to its position. Absolute is positioned relative to its parent and static is the default position and is not affected by any top, bottom, left, or right properties.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

	I found the basic html layout to be easiest as I understand the tags needed and where things need to be sectioned. The CSS part was tough for me because there are so many ways to do something and changing one thing changes another and then your back to changing the first thing... arrgh.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
	
	I learned that its best to take things one step at a time especially with styling. Start with the basics and how you want the layout to be before adding colors and font styles.
	Keeping yourself organized goes a long way. They mentioned in the release that we should not fall into a rabbit hole and its very hard not to. Time boxing is advised when creating your CSS documents.
