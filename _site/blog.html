Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. David Heinemeier Hansson is its creator. He gave it the name “Ruby on Rails,” though it is often just called “Rails.”</p>

Alright! We are in week 7 people! Ruby is over and we have now started our journey into JavaScript! I wish we could have started with JS because it seems to teach more fundamentals and show how the coding process works. I think this is due to the fact that JS requires you to create functions in order to do some of the things that Ruby has already built in. I’m looking at you enumerables and built in methods! Anyways lets talk about some of the differences between JS and Ruby.</p>

So the holidays are starting and I am finding that keeping up with DBC is starting to get difficult. It didn’t think that it would require so much of my time but every week seems to get harder and harder. This week was out third week of learning Ruby and it was during Thanksgiving and all the ridiculous Black Friday sales. I think the best part of this week was learning about Ruby classes.</p>

The weeks are getting harder and harder! This time we are in our second week of coding with Ruby and what a week it was. This week got a bit more advanced and a bit more confusing but im slowly understanding things. Lets talk Enumerables. Yeah its kinda hard to say at first that why my title was like that haha. Ruby’s enumerable module has built in methods for all kinds of things which operate in a collection. Its like trying to use the “each” method when trying to iterate over something but there is a enumerable that does this for what you want to do. So what does enumerable actually mean? The Enumerable module gives objects of collection classes additional collection-specific behaviors. The class requiring the Enumerable module must have an #each method because the additional collection-specific behaviors given by Enumerable are defined in terms of #each. Lets give you an example of one of the enumerable methods, map!</p>

We are at the end of week 4 and my head is burnt out on math and conditional statements! We did a huge refresh on the Ruby language this week and boy what a refresh it was. It started on a pretty easy review of basic Ruby like variables and methods, stuff that we sort of learned before starting phase 0. Then thats when it got harder for me. It went on to control flow with conditional statements and then we had to start thinking about math processes. Math that I haven’t done since high school! This stuff really picked at my brain and got me super frustrated. After all that it went on to Arrays and Hashes. What a review huh.</p>

Hey everyone! Second post and I already find myself showing off what I learned! We are currently in week 3 of the program and this week we are learning all about CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used in creating the styling part of a website and goes hand in hand with HTML. This week was tough for me because I spent a lot of time on the styling of my webpage. I wanted it a certain way and could not stand it when it wasnt going the way I wanted. The best part is, once your done with CSS your webpage will look amazing and just the way you want it!</p>

The first week of Devbootcamp is almost over! It feels like the week went by so fast! Its already friday and I have learned so much this week its crazy. So far we learned how to use the command line, whether it be using the terminal for mac users or the command prompt for windows and we also learned alot about version control using Git and GitHub. I actually had some experience learning some of the basic stuff beforehand but actually writing them and going through the process really helps to understand the concepts. With the command line, it will really help you to memorize the different commands and what they do. It also helps to use the terminal to do every single task without using your mouse so that you get used to it. Knowing how to navigate your terminal, create, modify and remove things are super mandatory for whats to come. Just knowing the commands and actually using my terminal, Im already starting to feel like a programmer!</p>
